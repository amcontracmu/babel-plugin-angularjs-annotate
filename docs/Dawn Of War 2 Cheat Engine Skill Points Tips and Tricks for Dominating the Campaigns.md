Cheat Engine is a tool that allows you to modify the memory of any running game or application. You can use it to change various values, such as health, money, or in this case, skill points. However, you should be careful when using Cheat Engine, as it may cause your game to crash or become unstable. Also, you should only use it for single-player mode, as using it for multiplayer mode may get you banned or reported by other players.

There are some things you should know before using Cheat Engine to get more skill points in Dawn of War 2. First, you should always make a backup of your save file before using Cheat Engine, in case something goes wrong or you want to revert to your original state. You can find your save file in the following location:
 `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\My Games\Dawn of War 2\Saved Games` 
Second, you should only use Cheat Engine for your own personal enjoyment and not to gain an unfair advantage over other players. Dawn of War 2 has an anti-cheat system that may detect your modifications and prevent you from playing online. If you want to play multiplayer mode, you should disable Cheat Engine and restore your original save file.

## Why Play PS2 Games on USB?
 
There are many reasons why you might want to play PS2 games on your USB drive. Here are some of them:

- You can save space on your shelf by storing your games digitally.
- You can protect your discs from scratches and damage.
- You can load your games faster and reduce noise and heat from the PS2 laser.
- You can play games from other regions that are not compatible with your PS2 console.
- You can play games that are rare or expensive to find.

## What Are the Limitations of Playing PS2 Games on USB?
 
Playing PS2 games on USB is not perfect. There are some limitations and drawbacks that you should be aware of:

- Not all games are compatible with USB Advance or OpenPS2Loader. Some games may not work at all, or have glitches, freezes, or crashes.
- The quality of your USB drive may affect the performance of your games. A slow or faulty USB drive may cause loading issues or lag.
- The file system of your USB drive may limit the number of games you can store. FAT32 has a maximum file size of 4 GB, which means you have to use the insane mode for larger games. NTFS has a maximum volume size of 32 GB, which means you have to partition your USB drive for larger capacities.
- The speed of your USB port may affect the loading time of your games. The PS2 has a USB 1.1 port, which has a maximum transfer rate of 12 Mbps. This is much slower than the DVD drive, which has a transfer rate of 24 Mbps.

Despite these limitations, playing PS2 games on USB is still a fun and convenient way to enjoy your favorite games. You just need to be patient and flexible with the process.

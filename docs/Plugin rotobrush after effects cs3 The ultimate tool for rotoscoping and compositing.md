## Step 1: Install the Plugin Roto Brush
 
The plugin Roto Brush is not included in the default installation of After Effects CS3, so you will need to download it from the Adobe website or from a third-party source. To install the plugin Roto Brush, follow these steps:
 
- Close After Effects CS3 if it is running.
- Locate the downloaded file and unzip it.
- Copy the folder "RotoBrush" and paste it into the "Plug-ins" folder of your After Effects CS3 installation directory. For example, if you installed After Effects CS3 in C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects CS3\Support Files\Plug-ins, then paste the folder "RotoBrush" there.
- Restart After Effects CS3 and check if the plugin Roto Brush is available in the "Effects" menu.

## Step 2: Apply the Plugin Roto Brush to Your Footage
 
Once you have installed the plugin Roto Brush, you can apply it to your footage and start creating rotoscoping effects. To do that, follow these steps:

- Import your footage into After Effects CS3 and create a new composition.
- Select your footage layer and go to "Effects" > "RotoBrush".
- A new window will open with your footage and a green brush cursor. This is where you will use the plugin Roto Brush to define the foreground elements that you want to isolate.
- Adjust the size and hardness of the brush using the "[" and "]" keys or by dragging the slider at the bottom of the window.
- Paint over the foreground elements that you want to isolate. The plugin Roto Brush will automatically create a mask around them and highlight them in pink. You can also use the Alt key to subtract areas from the mask or the Shift key to add areas to the mask.
- If you make a mistake, you can use the Ctrl+Z key to undo or the Eraser tool to erase parts of the mask.
- Once you are happy with your mask, click on the Freeze button at the bottom of the window. This will lock your mask and prevent any further changes.
- Close the window and go back to your composition. You will see that your footage layer has a new effect applied called "RotoBrush & Refine Edge". This effect allows you to refine your mask and adjust its parameters.

## Step 3: Refine Your Mask and Adjust Its Parameters
 
The plugin Roto Brush does a great job of creating a mask around your foreground elements, but it might not be perfect. You might need to refine your mask and adjust its parameters to get a more realistic and seamless result. To do that, follow these steps:

- Select your footage layer and go to "Effect Controls". You will see a panel with several options for the effect "RotoBrush & Refine Edge".
- To refine your mask, you can use the following options:
    - "Feather": This option allows you to soften or sharpen the edges of your mask. A higher value will create a softer edge, while a lower value will create a sharper edge.
    - "Choke": This option allows you to expand or contract your mask. A positive value will shrink your mask, while a negative value will enlarge your mask.
    - "Shift Edge": This option allows you to move your mask inward or outward. A positive value will move your mask outward, while a negative value will move your mask inward.
    - "Refine Edge Tool": This option allows you to manually refine your mask using a brush tool. You can use this tool to add or subtract details from your mask or smooth out 8cf37b1e13

## What is Waves SSL 4000 VST DX RTAS v1.2-AiR?
 
Waves SSL 4000 VST DX RTAS v1.2-AiR is a bundle of three plug-ins that emulate the sound and features of the Solid State Logic 4000 series consoles. These consoles were used by many legendary artists and producers, such as Michael Jackson, Queen, Nirvana, Metallica, and more.
 
Waves engineers spent more than a year analyzing and modeling the distinctive sonic characteristics of SL 4000 factory reference consoles and components provided by Solid State Logic. These plug-ins sound so close to the original consoles, even experts who work with SSL boards day in and day out canât tell the difference.
 
The plug-ins included in Waves SSL 4000 VST DX RTAS v1.2-AiR are:
 
- **SSL E-Channel:** This plug-in delivers the characteristic sound of the originalâs all-discrete design and its Class A, VCA chip. It features a High Pass Filter, Low Pass Filter, and a four-band parametric equalizer based on the renowned Black Knob equalizer. It also has a dynamics section with a soft-knee compressor/limiter and an expander/gate modeled on the SSL LS611E.
- **SSL G-Master Buss Compressor:** This plug-in is based on the renowned master buss center compressor of the SL 4000 G console. It captures the unique sound of its IC input and twin VCA gain-reduction amplifier design. This compressor has long been prized by top engineers for its ability to âglue togetherâ tracks, and is considered by many to be the ultimate finalizer that transforms a mix into a finished record.
- **SSL G-Equalizer:** This plug-in is a four-band equalizer modeled on the SSL G Series EQ292. It offers greater gain change than the E-Series EQ, and a slightly different curve. The SSL G-Equalizer includes a slight dip before a boost as well as a slight rise before a cut, which contribute to its incomparable sound.

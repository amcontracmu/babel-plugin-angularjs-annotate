The book aims to meet the needs of students and instructors in Asia by providing relevant examples, cases, and data from the region.

Each chapter begins with a learning objective and ends with a summary, key terms, questions, problems, and cases. The book also provides online resources for students and instructors, such as PowerPoint slides, Excel templates, quizzes, and solutions.
 
Fundamentals of Corporate Finance, Asia Global Edition is a comprehensive and up-to-date textbook that offers a solid foundation for students who want to learn about corporate finance in an Asian setting. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate courses in business schools and universities across Asia.
  
One of the main challenges that Asian corporations face is the high level of leverage and debt dependence. According to the OECD report, Corporate Finance in Asia and the COVID-19 Crisis[^1^] [^2^], Asian listed companies had an average debt-to-equity ratio of 97% in 2019, which was higher than the global average of 85%. Moreover, Asian companies relied heavily on bank loans as their main source of external financing, accounting for 60% of their total liabilities in 2019. This exposes them to higher refinancing risks and interest rate fluctuations.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the financial vulnerabilities of Asian corporations, especially those in sectors that were hit hard by the lockdowns and social distancing measures, such as tourism, hospitality, transportation, and retail. The OECD report estimates that the median earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of Asian listed companies declined by 23% in 2020, while their median interest coverage ratio dropped from 4.6 in 2019 to 3.3 in 2020. Furthermore, the share of zombie firms, defined as those with an interest coverage ratio below one for three consecutive years, increased from 7% in 2019 to 9% in 2020.
 
To cope with the liquidity crunch and solvency risks, Asian corporations have turned to market-based financing as an alternative or complementary source of funding. The OECD report shows that Asian companies issued a record amount of bonds and equity in 2020, reaching USD 2.4 trillion and USD 0.5 trillion respectively. The bond issuance was driven by both investment-grade and high-yield issuers, while the equity issuance was mainly concentrated in technology and health care sectors. The report also highlights that Asian authorities have implemented various fiscal and regulatory measures to support the corporate sectorâs access to finance during the pandemic, such as credit guarantees, tax relief, moratoria on loan repayments, relaxation of listing rules, and facilitation of capital raising.
